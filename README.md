Development & branching model
-------------------

Building

* If you want to build from IDE - use qt creator (SubutaiTray.pro project). If you want to build from command line, use commands listed below:

__Modify PATH. Like this : `export PATH=path_to_qmake_bin:$PATH`__

For __LINUX__  run `./build_linux.sh`. You can modify this script, it is very simple.

For __Mac OS__ do the same, but run `./build_mac.sh`

For __WINDOWS__ run this : `build_win.bat "path_to libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll"`
